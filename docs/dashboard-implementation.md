# Looker Studio implementation contract

This document connects the generated parity manifest to the canonical report
implementation. It contains no report ID, production project/dataset name, or
result values.

## Data-source boundary

The report has exactly one embedded BigQuery data source. Its custom query is
the rendered form of `sql/events_v1.sql.tmpl`; the 37 files under
`oracle/queries/` are independent validation queries and are never added as
extra report data sources.

The public template embeds the executable synthetic sentinel query from
`sql/events_v1.template.sql`. `tools/hydrate_dashboard.py` validates the
caller's BQAA base table and generated views, then emits a Linking API URL
whose `sqlReplace` replaces the sentinel project, dataset, and view prefix.
The new data source is created with the clicking user's credentials. The
template never exposes or delegates the template owner's BigQuery access.

`docs/index.html` provides the standard-installation path without requiring a
local CLI. It accepts project, dataset, and table IDs, assumes the standard
`v` generated-view prefix and uses the project as the billing project by
default, with optional advanced overrides for both, then constructs the same
Linking API URL entirely in the browser. URL query
parameters can prefill the three inputs, but the page never opens the report
without a user click.

Looker Studio report parameters are not the binding mechanism. They can pass
scalar values to BigQuery custom SQL, but BigQuery query parameters cannot
replace identifiers in `FROM` paths. Connector-level Linking API
`sqlReplace` is therefore required to bind the project, dataset, and generated
view prefix. The base table ID is retained for installation identity and
report naming; charts read the 15 BQAA-generated views. The authenticated CLI
is the only path that preflight-validates that table and view contract.

The canonical report is shared as Public/Viewer, uses Viewer's Credentials,
and has manual report publishing enabled. Its published title is
`BigQuery Agent Analytics — Template`. A signed-out visitor is sent to Google
sign-in; after sign-in, the Linking API review dialog shows the substituted
custom SQL and the caller's billing project before the caller acknowledges it.

The live report and sentinel fixture are contributor-managed pending transfer
to Google-managed ownership. `bindings/report_template.yaml` records a
SHA-256 and review date for the repository's rendered query. Its deliberately
narrow `repository_artifact_only` scope must not be represented as an
attestation of the mutable live report. Until transfer, a release reviewer
must manually compare the live embedded query with the reviewed artifact.

Token fields accept both BQAA `usage_metadata` shapes observed in supported
installations, in this order:

1. pinned LookML keys: `prompt_token_count`, `candidates_token_count`,
   `total_token_count`;
2. alternate BQAA keys: `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`;
3. the generated-view fallback columns.

Malformed metadata values use `SAFE_CAST` and fall through instead of
aborting every report chart.

## Pages and chart inventory

The report implements all 37 manifest charts plus one non-parity Trace
Inspector table:

| Page | Manifest charts |
|---|---:|
| Token Consumption | 4 |
| Agent & Sessions | 7 |
| Tool Usage | 3 |
| LLM Interactions | 3 |
| User Analytics | 4 |
| Latency | 12 |
| Errors | 4 |
| **Total parity charts** | **37** |
| Trace Inspector | 1 additional table |

The Inspector exposes timestamp, event type, agent, user, trace, span, and
status from the same production data source. It is a drill-through aid, not a
38th parity tile.

All seven dashboard pages use a rolling 365-day window ending yesterday.
Looker Studio sends those bounds through `@DS_START_DATE` and
`@DS_END_DATE`; the production query applies the frozen half-open UTC
predicate. The generated manifest retains the pinned LookML's original
14-day Usage and 7-day Performance defaults as source-provenance metadata;
the published template intentionally overrides them for the product default.
The Trace Inspector has no default date control.

## Looker Studio measure mappings

The stable source fields map to report measures as follows:

| Manifest measure | Looker Studio implementation |
|---|---|
| total events | `Record Count` |
| total invocations | `COUNT_DISTINCT(invocation_id)` |
| total traces | `COUNT_DISTINCT(trace_id)` |
| total sessions | `COUNT_DISTINCT(session_id)` |
| total users | `COUNT_DISTINCT(user_id)` |
| total tokens | `SUM(usage_total_tokens)` |
| LLM calls | `COUNT_DISTINCT(llm_response_pk)` |
| tool calls | `COUNT_DISTINCT(tool_completed_pk)` |
| tool errors | `COUNT_DISTINCT(tool_error_pk)` |
| average LLM latency | `AVG(llm_total_ms)` |
| average tool latency | `AVG(tool_completed_total_ms)` |
| LLM percentile Pn | `PERCENTILE(llm_total_ms, n)` |
| tool percentile Pn | `PERCENTILE(tool_completed_total_ms, n)` |

Dimensions use the stable fields directly. Tool-only and error-only charts
use the typed `tool_completed_*` and `tool_error_*` fields so null rows from
other union branches do not contribute to the measure.

## Real-data smoke validation

On 2026-07-23, the read-only live validator:

- passed the 15-view/column preflight;
- executed the exact production custom query for the report window;
- executed all 37 independent oracle queries against a real BQAA dataset;
- reported 37 successes and zero failures.

No live result rows or source identifiers are committed. This smoke result
proves installation compatibility and query executability; it does not replace
seeded parity certification or M4 visual sign-off.
